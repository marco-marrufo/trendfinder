macOS Installation:

Due to the large number of dependencies with this project, it is highly recommended to install and set-up a virtualenv to
create an isolated Python environment for TrendFinder.

Please see the guide below for installing and setting up virtualenv

For jupyter notebook, you may need to set-up a separate kernel to work with the virtualenv. See the guide below.
